=======================

Bootstrap based Moodle (More) Theme

To the 'More' theme a small image has been added to the top 'NavBar'.  Now, instead of just having your site
name as HTML text in this top 'NavBar' you can add a small logo or other branding.

TODO:

- Add a field in the settings to determine what this image/branding links to (currently this image hyperlinks to the 
logged in users profile)

- limit maximum size of uploaded image (in CSS)
